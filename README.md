# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **RSA Factoring Challenge**! This project is a cryptographic challenge that involves factorizing large numbers to determine their prime components. The challenge is based on the principles of **RSA encryption**, which relies on the difficulty of prime factorization for security.

## Objective

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a program that factorizes numbers as quickly as possible. The goal is to break down numbers into a product of two smaller numbers or, in the case of the RSA challenge, two prime numbers.

This project is optional and designed to push your understanding of number theory and computational efficiency.

## Requirements

### General

- You can use any programming language of your choice.
- The operating system is **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
- The program must run **without any dependencies**, meaning you cannot install additional packages.
- Execution time is limited to **5 seconds** per run.
- The repository should include all source code and scripts needed to run the program.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/RSA-Factoring-Challenge.git
   cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge
   ```
2. Compile the source code (if necessary).
3. Run the programs with a test file:
   ```sh
   ./factors tests/test00
   ./rsa tests/rsa-1
   ```
